        <p>
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
             objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means 
             to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text 
             such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
             Tags such as img tag and input tag directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about
             document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. T

        <h3 id="basic-structure">what is basic structure of HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
             character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like
             &#60;h1&#62; and &#60;/h1&#62;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such 
             pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
            
             The text between html tag describes the web page, and the text between
              body tag is the visible page content. The markup text title tag.
              This is a title tag defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs
            and window titles, and the tag div tag defines a division of the page used for
            easy styling. Between head tag, a meta tag element can be used to define webpage metadata.
            The Document Type Declaration DOCType tag is for HTML5. If a declaration 
            is not included,various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.

        <h3 id="html-element" >what are html elements?</h3>
        <p>
            HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are
             indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus
             p tag.In the simple, general case,the extent of an element is indicated by a 
            pair of tags.The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
            Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, 
            including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested)
            elements, as children of the parent element.
            The start tag may also include element's attributes within the tag.
             These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document

        <p>
            Definition and Usage. The body tag defines the document's body. The body element contains
            all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs,images, hyperlinks,
            tables, lists, etc. Note: There can only be one body element in an HTML document.
            This elemnet include global attribute like alinke,background,bgcolor.

        <h3 id="list-tag">List tag</h3>
        <p>
            The &#60;li&#62; HTML element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be
            contained in a parent element: an ordered list (&#60;ol&#62;), an unordered 
            list (&#60;ul&#62;), or a menu (&#60;menue&#62;). In menus and unordered lists, list items are
             usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually 
             displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.
             this element include value,type.
        </p>
        <h3 id="image-tag">img tag</h3>
        <p>
            The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

            Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
        <ul>
            The <img> tag has two required attributes:

           <li> src - Specifies the path to the image</li>
            <li>    alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some
            reason cannot be displayed.</li>
        </ul>

        Note:always specify the width and height of an image.
         If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.
        </p>
        <h3 id="form-tag">Form tag</h3>
        <p>
            The HTML &#60;form &#62; element provide a document section to take input from user.
             It provides various interactive controls for submitting information to web 
             server such as text field, text area, password field, etc.
             The &#60;form &#62; element is a container for different types of input elements,
             such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.
